The seller retains legal title to the property until the balance is paid; the buyer gets legal title to the property once the final payment is made. **Contract-for-deed agreements may have higher interest rates compared to traditional mortgage loans, resulting in increased costs for the buyer**. If the buyer defaults on the payments, the seller can repossess the property. **Buyers entering into contract-for-deed agreements may face difficulties in obtaining financing or refinancing options in the future**. In some states, a seller who repossesses a property must reimburse the buyer for the fair value of improvements to the house, as well as a reasonable amount for rent.\n\nOur Contract for Deed contracts are suitable for most types of property including residential, commercial property, land and farmland. These documents can be made suitable for all 50 states.\nWhen to use a Contract for Deed:\n\nA Purchase Agreement has been signed by the Buyer and Seller of real property who are ready to proceed with finalizing the transaction.\nYou are selling real property to a Buyer who is unable to obtain financing through a bank or other financial institution and you have decided to act as the financer.\nYou are buying real property from a Seller who is willing to allow you to reside on the property while you make payments toward to total purchase price.\nYou are a Buyer who has no established credit or bad credit and wish to purchase a home by making payments on the sales price to the Seller without financing with a bank or other financial institution.\nYou want to determine the amount of a monthly payment on a loan contract.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample Contract for Deed\nThe terms in your document will update based on the information you provide\n\n\n\n\n\nThis document has been customized over 375K times\n\n\n\nLegally binding and enforceable\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer questions about your document\n\n\n\n\nExpand \n\n\n    THIS SPACE PROVIDED FOR RECORDER'S USE                           WHEN RECORDED RETURN TO:       CONTRACT FOR DEED     This Contract (\"Contract\") is effective as of  by and between           , ,, Trustee,        hereinafter referred to as \"SELLER,\" whether one or more, and           , Trustee, , , , ,  , , a single person, a married couple,        hereinafter referred to as \"BUYER,\" whether one or more, on the terms and conditions and for the purposes hereinafter set forth.      PROPERTY.

This type of property purchase agreement does not require that the buyer qualifies for bank financing. While it may not be wise to sell your property to someone with poor credit, this type of agreement may be advantageous if the buyer simply doesn't have a large enough down payment for a bank loan yet. Or, a Contract of Deed agreement may be good for the seller when interest rates are high or if the property has been difficult to sell.\nA typical Contract for Deed has a fixed term, usually a few years, and a monthly payment. The buyer and seller usually agree on property responsibilities during the term, such as seller access to the property and tax obligations. While the seller holds the title, the buyer receives the benefits of an equitable title. An equitable title gives the buyer nearly the same privileges they would have as an owner, unless the buyer and seller agree otherwise.\nInterest rates on a Contract for Deed are not regulated, so buyers and sellers will need to negotiate. Similarly, the payments can be structured in any fashion that is agreeable to both parties. In some cases, the value of the house may be divided into equal payments so that the full balance is paid off by the end of the term. In others, regular payments are set up with the balance coming due in a balloon payment at the end of the term. Typically, these contracts can be renegotiated so long as both parties are willing.\nInformation needed to make a Contract for Deed\nIt is simple to create a Contract for Deed using our document interview, but the process will go faster if you gather essential information ahead of time. Here is what you'll need to complete the contract:\nProperty details\nThe property address and a legal description of property being sold. The legal description can be found on Seller's title or Deed or may be obtained from a local property tax office.\nBuyer and seller information\nYou'll need the full legal names of all parties involved plus their contact information. If buyer and seller reside in different states, you'll need to specify which state laws apply.\nPrice and payment information\nInclude the agreed upon purchase price, down payment amount, interest rate and payment details. You should also outline the payment schedule and how and where payments are to be made.\nPayment terms\nBesides monthly payments, you'll want to define if they will have to pay a final lump sum or balloon payment at the end of the term. For example, some sellers may choose to carry the loan for an agreed upon time, but then require that the buyer obtain another form of financing to purchase the property outright.\nSeller debt\nIf the seller has existing loans on the property you'll need to include creditor and loan information.\nProperty use and access\nIn most cases, the buyer will reside in and use the property as if they were the owner. Which also means, they would be responsible for maintenance. If the seller is responsible for certain repairs, make sure they are listed in the contract with the dates the work is expected to be completed.\nInsurance and taxes\nState who will be responsible for insurance including homeowner, fire, flood and personal property. Also, decide who will be responsible for property tax payments and assessments. \n\n\n\nIs a Land Contract the same as Rent to Own?\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth are suitable for situations where the buyer is not ready to buy the property using bank financing. The major difference is that in a Contract for Deed agreement the buyer usually takes possession of the property as if they bought it. For example, the buyer is often responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes. Whereas in a Rent to Own Agreement  , the buyer is like a leasee and the owner is usually responsible for larger maintenance issues and property taxes. Similarities include that the contract may be canceled for nonpayment or if the seller experiences a foreclosure. \n\n\n\nHow does a Contract for Deed benefit the seller?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the advantages lie on the side of the buyer since they would not be able to qualify for the purchase on their own. But there are a few incentives for sellers. For example, when real estate interest rates are high enough that people are putting off buying, you may be able to sell your property by offering a lower interest rate. If you have been trying to sell a vacant property for a long time, a Contract for Deed agreement, like a Lease to Own agreement, will give you immediate ongoing income for a property that was just costing you money. \n\n\n\nHow does a Contract for Deed benefit the buyer?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe largest advantage for the buyer is that you don't have to qualify for bank financing. You can get into the property quickly without a large down payment, you can make improvements on the property, you may receive tax advantages, and you have time to improve your credit situation. You may also benefit from a lower than market interest rate. Advantages for commercial buyers is that you can lease the properties to cover the cost of the agreement, perhaps even with a profit.\nHowever, there are some cons. For example, you may be ready to buy and find out there are issues with the title or that the owner has liens on the property. Or, if the owner loses the property from foreclosure or death, you'd be out all the payments you made in most cases; however, as long as the document is recorded, the buyer is generally protected. (In our document, there is a section that will direct the buyer to record the contract.)\nOther helpful topics:\n\nWhat's the Difference Between a Property Deed and a Title? \nHow to Transfer Real Estate \nTypes of Property Deeds \n\nIf you have any questions about Contract for Deeds, we can connect you with a lawyer  for quick answers or a document review. \n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Document In Just 3 Easy Steps:            \n\n\n\n\nBuild your document\nAnswer a few simple questions to make your document in minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave now, finish later\nStart now and save your progress, finish on any device\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload, print & share\nStore securely, share online and make copies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated documents\nRocket Lawyer members who started a free Contract for Deed also made:\n\n\n\n\n\nMortgage Agreement\nEstablish a lien on property to secure a loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeed of Trust\nDesignate a trustee to hold the land title\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSatisfaction of Mortgage\nConfirm that a mortgage has been repaid\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeed of Reconveyance\nProve full repayment of a property loan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Explore other Real estate documents\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer\nOur network attorneys are here for you.\n\n\n\n\nInput your question here\n\n0/600\n\n\n\nYou've exceeded the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Lawyer Network Attorneys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for something else?\n\n\n\nSearch query input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your Contract for Deed now and get Rocket Lawyer FREE for 7 days\nGet legal services you can trust at prices you can afford.

Deed benefit the seller?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn most cases, the advantages lie on the side of the buyer since they would not be able to qualify for the purchase on their own. \n\n\n\nIs a Land Contract the same as Rent to Own?\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth are suitable for situations where the buyer is not ready to buy the property using bank financing.

Advantages for commercial buyers is that you can lease the properties to cover the cost of the agreement, perhaps even with a profit.\nHowever, there are some cons. All payments on this Contract shall be applied first in payment of accrued interest, if applicable, and any remainder in payment of principal. Also, decide who will be responsible for property tax payments and assessments. An equitable title gives the buyer nearly the same privileges they would have as an owner, unless the buyer and seller agree otherwise.\nInterest rates on a Contract for Deed are not regulated, so buyers and sellers will need to negotiate. Any notice or communication required or permitted under this Contract shall be sufficiently given if delivered in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the addresses listed above or to such other address as one party may have furnished to the other in writing. But there are a few incentives for sellers. Buyer Seller                 , ,                 DATED:___________________________                                  , ,   STATE OF ss:, ss: and . Buyer agrees that any and all buildings, permanent fixtures and improvements currently on or subsequently added to the land or Property may not be removed, but will remain on the Property until the contract is fully performed. Buyer shall be responsible for all personal taxes or assessments that result from the Buyer's use of the Property. Contact your county recorder to determine acceptable exemptions. Contact your local county recorder's office for this certificate. Failure to comply with this requirement places the Seller at risk of being fined. For example, some sellers may choose to carry the loan for an agreed upon time, but then require that the buyer obtain another form of financing to purchase the property outright.\nSeller debt\nIf the seller has existing loans on the property you'll need to include creditor and loan information.\nProperty use and access\nIn most cases, the buyer will reside in and use the property as if they were the owner. For example, the buyer is often responsible for maintenance, insurance and taxes. For example, when real estate interest rates are high enough that people are putting off buying, you may be able to sell your property by offering a lower interest rate. For example, you may be ready to buy and find out there are issues with the title or that the owner has liens on the property. Here is what you'll need to complete the contract:\nProperty details\nThe property address and a legal description of property being sold. If a court finds that any provision of this Contract for Deed is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any payment obligation under this Contract is not paid when due, the Buyer promises to pay all costs of collection, including reasonable attorney fees, whether or not a lawsuit is commenced as part of the collection process. If any portion of this Contract for Deed shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If buyer and seller reside in different states, you'll need to specify which state laws apply.\nPrice and payment information\nInclude the agreed upon purchase price, down payment amount, interest rate and payment details. If five or fewer parcels of land are being sold in an Unincorporated area of the county, please contact a RocketLawyer OnCallÂ® Attorney as more disclosures may be required in this Contract for Deed. If the buyer defaults on the payments, the seller can repossess the property. If the information is not known, the notice should state this fact. If the seller is responsible for certain repairs, make sure they are listed in the contract with the dates the work is expected to be completed.\nInsurance and taxes\nState who will be responsible for insurance including homeowner, fire, flood and personal property. If you are selling real property that has not been improved or developed you must provide the Buyer with a written notice disclosing the location of a transportation pipeline for gas, petroleum or a petroleum product or any hazardous substance. If you have been trying to sell a vacant property for a long time, a Contract for Deed agreement, like a Lease to Own agreement, will give you immediate ongoing income for a property that was just costing you money. In addition to any and all other rights available according to law, if either party defaults by failing to substantially perform any material provision, term or condition of this Contract (including without limitation the failure to make a monetary payment when due), the other party may elect to cancel this Contract if the default is not cured within  days after providing written notice to the defaulting party. In others, regular payments are set up with the balance coming due in a balloon payment at the end of the term. In some cases, the value of the house may be divided into equal payments so that the full balance is paid off by the end of the term. In some states, a seller who repossesses a property must reimburse the buyer for the fair value of improvements to the house, as well as a reasonable amount for rent.\n\nOur Contract for Deed contracts are suitable for most types of property including residential, commercial property, land and farmland. In the event of default by the Buyer under this Contract, any and all permanent fixtures and improvements made on the Property will remain with the Property. NON-SUFFICIENT FUNDS.

Upon receipt of all payments required under this Contract, the Seller will furnish the Buyer with a wherein the Seller conveys all of their interest in the Property to the Buyer. Whereas in a Rent to Own Agreement  , the buyer is like a leasee and the owner is usually responsible for larger maintenance issues and property taxes. Which also means, they would be responsible for maintenance. While it may not be wise to sell your property to someone with poor credit, this type of agreement may be advantageous if the buyer simply doesn't have a large enough down payment for a bank loan yet.

You may also benefit from a lower than market interest rate.
