A single lump sum payment may be made at the completion of service or at some other defined date or event. A typical waiver of breach clause states that, if either party waives their right to enforce the contract or recover damages after a breach by the other party, that will not prevent future actions to enforce the contract or claim damages.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for Finding and Working With Freelancers\n\n\nIt is easier than ever to find freelance workers for nearly any type of project. APPLICABLE LAW. All terms and conditions contained in any other writings previously executed by the parties regarding the matters contemplated herein shall be deemed to be merged herein and superseded hereby.

Either party may entrust confidential information to the other, although it is more common for employers to entrust such information to independent contractors.

Examples may include inventions, designs, formulas, computer code, and other data developed by or for the business. Except in extraordinary circumstances and when necessary, the Contractor shall perform the Services without direct supervision by the Recipient.

However, you still need to choose the right freelancer for your needs and maintain a positive relationship. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If one provision turns out to be unenforceable or unlawful, that could mean that the entire contract is invalid. If that is the case, the parties may choose to have the agreement continue in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate or end it. If the Contractor has assistants, it is the Contractor's responsibility to hire them and to provide materials for them. If the agreement is for services that will be provided on an ongoing basis, fixed wages can be defined to pay for the services at an hourly rate or other period of payment. If the arrangement between the Recipient and the Contractor conforms more closely to the characteristics of an employee/employer relationship, the Employment Agreement may be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Document In Just 3 Easy Steps:            \n\n\n\n\nBuild your document\nAnswer a few simple questions to make your document in minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave, print & share\nSave progress and finish on any device, download & print anytime\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign & make it legal\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated documents\nRocket Lawyer members who started a free Independent Contractor Agreement also made:\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\nEnsure that proprietary information stays private\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Contract\nMake your new hire official\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract for Services\nSet clear terms and conditions for any services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncompete Agreement\nProtect your company's proprietary information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Explore other Business and contracts documents\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer\nOur network attorneys are here for you.\n\n\n\n\nInput your question here\n\n0/600\n\n\n\nYou've exceeded the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Lawyer Network Attorneys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for something else?\n\n\n\nSearch query input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your Independent Contractor Agreement now and get Rocket Lawyer FREE for 7 days\nGet legal services you can trust at prices you can afford.

This contract defines not only the services to be provided and the compensation to be given, but also defines the relationship between the parties. It is designed to clearly establish the Contractor as an independent contractor and not as the Recipientâs employee. Of course, if an employment relationship is desired by both parties, then an Employment Contract might be used. If you are not sure about the employment relationship, you should consult with a Rocket Lawyer network attorney for affordable legal advice.\nHere are the main provisions found in an Independent Contractor Agreement, along with descriptions of what the provisions contain and what they mean.\nRecipient of Services\nIncludes the full name of the company, as well as the name and title of the representative who will sign the agreement on the company's behalf. For example: ABC Widget Corporation, Tanya Jones, President.\nContractor\nIncludes the full name and address of the service provider. \nDescription of Services\nA description of the services to be provided is an essential part of an Independent Contractor Agreement. You may list services on a separate attachment to the agreement if the list is long, and then refer to the attachment in the agreement. For example, \"As described in the attached Exhibit.\"\nPayment for Services\nThis clause describes how payment will be made. A single lump sum payment may be made at the completion of service or at some other defined date or event. Multiple installment payments may be made on specific dates or after specific events have occurred, such as completion of various stages of a project. If the agreement is for services that will be provided on an ongoing basis, fixed wages can be defined to pay for the services at an hourly rate or other period of payment. These are common payment options, but custom payment terms can be written into the contract.    \nIt is not unusual for a Contractor to provide services based on an hourly rate or other fixed wage. However, if payment (based on the fixed wage) is made weekly or biweekly, the IRS may view such an arrangement as indicating an employer/employee relationship. It is recommended that you read about the IRS guidelines in the Employee vs. Independent Contractor section below. Generally, Paying a lump sum fee upon completion of the services is generally recommended to avoid a determination by the IRS that the Contractor is an employee.\nTerm / Termination\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement often specifies when the agreement will end. If the parties know in advance when the services of the Contractor will no longer be needed, that specific date can be entered.  \nThe parties sometimes want an ongoing relationship. If that is the case, the parties may choose to have the agreement continue in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate or end it. This gives the parties the flexibility to agree to a long term commitment while retaining some freedom to end the contract when necessary.  \nFinally, if the services will be needed for only one job or project of unknown length, it may be best to state that the contractor agreement will terminate upon the completion of the particular project for which the Contractor is being retained. \nRelationship of Parties\nDefining the relationship of the parties is an important part of an Independent Contractor Agreement. The activities that are the responsibility of the Contractor versus the Recipient helps to establish that the Contractor is not the Recipientâs employee. \nRecipientâs Control\nThis clause establishes that the Recipient is not in control of how the Contractor does their work.\nProfessional Capacity\nThis clause establishes that the Contractor is a professional and does not require training from the Recipient in order to do their work.\nPersonal Services Not Required\nThis provision states clearly that the Contractor is not required to perform services personally, but may, instead, hire others to perform the services required under the contract.\nNo Location on Premises\nThis provision states that the Contractor does not have equipment or a desk located at or furnished by the Recipient.\nNo Set Work Hours\nThis clause confirms that the Contractor has no set hours and is not required to work a set number of hours.\nExpenses Paid by Contractor\nThis clause establishes that business and travel expenses will be paid by the Contractor, not the Recipient.\nOwnership of Social Media Contacts\nIf the Independent Contractor will create, operate, or maintain social media accounts for the Recipient, this clause can spell out who will own the contacts associated with the accounts.\nIndependent Contractor Confidentiality\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement sometimes includes a clause that obligates the Contractor to protect and not disclose the Recipient's proprietary or confidential information. \"Confidential information\" is information that is unique, and for which there would be harm if it was disclosed. This provision sometimes also includes a sentence that requires the Contractor to return the Recipient's records.\nLiability Insurance and Indemnity\nThe Recipient may wish to include several provisions that extend protections to the Recipient for the actions of the Contractor. The Recipient may wish to require that the Contractor obtain insurance to cover all of its employees as to this particular agreement. Having proof of insurance for the activity that the agreement will govern provides additional protection to the Recipient. \nSimilarly, a Recipient can also require that the Contractor indemnify the Recipient for any injuries that the Recipient may encounter or cause through the acts of the Contractor. This essentially means that the Contractor is responsible if something or someone is harmed because of the activities of the Contractor. \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Independent Contractor Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nDefinition \n\n\n\n\nConfidential Information\n\n\nPrivate information regarding the business operations of an employer or independent contractor, such as client lists, processes, formulas, or payroll data. Either party may entrust confidential information to the other, although it is more common for employers to entrust such information to independent contractors. The contract between the parties might include a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) or confidentiality clause that prevents either party from revealing the otherâs confidential information.\n\n\n\n\nEmployer-Employee Relationship\n\n\nA relationship by which an employee performs work for the employer, and the employer provides, at a minimum, financial compensation. Each party to this relationship has obligations to the other:\n\n\nThe employee must perform their job duties according to their agreement with the employer.\n\n\nThe employer must pay the employee and provide other benefits or perks according to their agreement. They must also abide by all applicable local, state, and federal employment laws.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndemnification\n\n\nA form of risk allocation between the parties to a contract, in which one party agrees to cover losses suffered by the other party, or to defend them against legal claims brought in connection with the contract. An indemnification clause in an independent contractor agreement, for example, might state that the independent contractor will be liable for legal claims by third parties arising from their services for the employer, and that the independent contractor will cover the cost of any such claim brought against the employer.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Contractor\n\n\nAn individual or business that has an employment relationship with an employer, but is not an employee. Independent contractors often have their own established business or trade that exists separate from the employer. Compared to employees, they are subject to less control by the employer over how, when, and where they do their work. They are also not covered by employment statutes that address matters like workplace discrimination, minimum wage, or overtime pay.\n\n\n\n\nPrincipal-Agent Relationship\n\n\nAn arrangement between two parties in which one party (the principal) grants legal authority to the other party (the agent) to act on its behalf. The principal can grant broad authority to the agent, or it can limit the agentâs authority to certain acts, issues, or matters. The agentâs authority may be subject to change or revocation by the principal.\nWhen acting on behalf of the principal, the agent has a fiduciary duty to put the principalâs interests first. Any conflict of interest can cause the agent to be legally liable to the principal.\n\n\n\n\nProprietary Information\n\n\nConfidential information possessed by an employer, to which an independent contractor or employee may have access in the course of their employment. Examples may include inventions, designs, formulas, computer code, and other data developed by or for the business. Proprietary information that has value to the employer by virtue of not being widely known to the general public is known as âtrade secrets.â Independent contractors may be expected to safeguard the secrecy of proprietary information under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA). They may face legal liability, either under law or contract, for misusing or appropriating such information.\n\n\n\n\nSeverability\n\n\nA clause often included in contracts stating that each provision of the contract is independent of the others. If one provision turns out to be unenforceable or unlawful, that could mean that the entire contract is invalid. A severability clause states that the illegal or unenforceable provision can be removed â or severed â and the rest of the contract will remain valid and in force. The parties may then modify or rewrite the invalid provision.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver of Breach\n\n\nA clause commonly included in independent contractor agreements that addresses the enforceability of the contract. A typical waiver of breach clause states that, if either party waives their right to enforce the contract or recover damages after a breach by the other party, that will not prevent future actions to enforce the contract or claim damages.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for Finding and Working With Freelancers\n\n\nIt is easier than ever to find freelance workers for nearly any type of project. There are numerous online resources for finding contract workers for technical gigs such as app building, website creation, and content writing. You can also find online connections to people who do onsite jobs such as lawn care, home repair, or dog walking. An advantage to using an online or staffing service is that they often take care of most of the paperwork for you. However, you still need to choose the right freelancer for your needs and maintain a positive relationship. Here are some tips for doing just that.\nEvaluating Freelancers\nOnline freelancer platforms offer a number of ways to evaluate freelancers based on skills and performance. Look for the following information: \n\nClient reviews\nProject completions (the number of projects the freelancer has completed)\nPortfolios or examples of work\nResponse time\nRecent employment\nEducation or certifications\nSkills test scores\n\nIf you need someone to create assets for you, such as illustrations, infographics, photos, design templates, a website, articles, blog posts, social media posts, videos, etc., be sure to ask for examples of their work before hiring them. Most freelance creatives will have a portfolio to show prospective clients. \nAlso consider scheduling an in-person, phone, or video interview in addition to checking available information about the freelancer. Whether youâre looking for a remote freelancer or someone to do an in-person job, such as a gardener, pet sitter, or maintenance worker, an in-person interview or, at the very least, a video call, often helps to finalize the decision and is worth the extra time and effort. \nWorking with Freelancers\nOnce you have engaged a freelancer, make sure you are all on the same page regarding what you expect to be done or delivered, any milestones and deadlines, and how and when to communicate should anything about the project change. An Independent Contractor Agreement can help you get the details in a written document that is signed by both parties. This agreement can also include a confidentiality clause that requires the freelancer to keep any sensitive business information confidential, protecting you and your businessâ trade secrets.\nLeveraging the Freelance Network\nIf you end up having a positive experience and a good relationship with the freelancer youâve hired, you may decide to provide a favorable review or refer them to your colleagues if they need similar work done. It is also helpful to network with good freelancers since they may have connections to other talent you may need to help you with future projects. And positive reviews about their project experience with you can help foster beneficial future business relationships.\nWorking with freelancers can be a great experience if you choose freelancers carefully, be clear about what you need, get the arrangement in writing and signed by both parties, and communicate regularly throughout the project. \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Contractor Agreement FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse all\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy does a business owner need an Independent Contractor Agreement?\n\n\n\n\n\nA business owner needs an Independent Contractor Agreement for several reasons.\nSetting Expectations: An Independent Contractor Agreement explicitly sets out the expectations and parameters of the work to be done, the compensation, and the nature of the relationship itself. It is a clear-cut explanation of the expected workflow, how communication will be handled, and how the relationship will work.\nWork Product Ownership: An Independent Contractor Agreement protects your business interests by:\n\n\nEstablishing ownership of any work product generated as a result of the arrangement.\n\n\nRequiring contractors to actively protect trade secrets.\n\n\nProviding for confidentiality and non-disclosure of key business information.\n\n\nAffirming the Independent Contractor-Client Relationship: Employers are required to do certain things for employees that they are not required to do for independent contractors, so it's important to affirm the relationship in writing. For example, independent contractors are responsible for paying all of their own income taxes, while employers are required to deduct part of the employees' taxes from their paychecks. Employers usually provide some benefits to employees, such as health insurance and paid time off. These benefits are not offered to independent contractors.\nHaving a contract alone may not necessarily protect you from a contractor later claiming they were an employee, but it may be a good thing to do nonetheless because it indicates the intention to have an independent contractor-client arrangement at the outset of the relationship. You might seek further protection by having an attorney review your Independent Contractor Agreement or seeking answers to questions you might have. \n\n\n\nWhat should be included in an Independent Contractor Agreement?\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Independent Contractor Agreement should contain all of these basic terms:\n\nDescription of the services to be provided.\nHow payment will be handled, whether hourly or on a per-project basis.\nTerm of the agreement, typically with a definitive end date.\nExplanation of what the hiring party will provide or not provide, such as equipment, for the independent contractor to use.\nOwnership of work product if that is relevant to the work being performed.\nConfidentiality clause.\nApplicable governing law of the agreement.\n\nThese terms, as well as several others, are included in this free Independent Contractor Agreement. \n\n\n\nWhat are options for signing an Independent Contractor Agreement remotely?\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are various options available for signing an Independent Contractor Agreement remotely, but the most efficient way is to use a third-party application, such as RocketSignÂ®, to sign the document electronically.

A severability clause states that the illegal or unenforceable provision can be removed â or severed â and the rest of the contract will remain valid and in force. A single lump sum payment may be made at the completion of service or at some other defined date or event. A typical waiver of breach clause states that, if either party waives their right to enforce the contract or recover damages after a breach by the other party, that will not prevent future actions to enforce the contract or claim damages.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for Finding and Working With Freelancers\n\n\nIt is easier than ever to find freelance workers for nearly any type of project. APPLICABLE LAW. All terms and conditions contained in any other writings previously executed by the parties regarding the matters contemplated herein shall be deemed to be merged herein and superseded hereby.

An Independent Contractor Agreement can help you get the details in a written document that is signed by both parties. An advantage to using an online or staffing service is that they often take care of most of the paperwork for you.

Either party may entrust confidential information to the other, although it is more common for employers to entrust such information to independent contractors. Employers usually provide some benefits to employees, such as health insurance and paid time off. Examples may include inventions, designs, formulas, computer code, and other data developed by or for the business. Except in extraordinary circumstances and when necessary, the Contractor shall perform the Services without direct supervision by the Recipient.

However, you still need to choose the right freelancer for your needs and maintain a positive relationship. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If one provision turns out to be unenforceable or unlawful, that could mean that the entire contract is invalid. If that is the case, the parties may choose to have the agreement continue in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate or end it. If the Contractor has assistants, it is the Contractor's responsibility to hire them and to provide materials for them. If the agreement is for services that will be provided on an ongoing basis, fixed wages can be defined to pay for the services at an hourly rate or other period of payment. If the arrangement between the Recipient and the Contractor conforms more closely to the characteristics of an employee/employer relationship, the Employment Agreement may be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Document In Just 3 Easy Steps:            \n\n\n\n\nBuild your document\nAnswer a few simple questions to make your document in minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave, print & share\nSave progress and finish on any device, download & print anytime\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign & make it legal\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated documents\nRocket Lawyer members who started a free Independent Contractor Agreement also made:\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\nEnsure that proprietary information stays private\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Contract\nMake your new hire official\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract for Services\nSet clear terms and conditions for any services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncompete Agreement\nProtect your company's proprietary information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Explore other Business and contracts documents\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer\nOur network attorneys are here for you.\n\n\n\n\nInput your question here\n\n0/600\n\n\n\nYou've exceeded the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Lawyer Network Attorneys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for something else?\n\n\n\nSearch query input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your Independent Contractor Agreement now and get Rocket Lawyer FREE for 7 days\nGet legal services you can trust at prices you can afford.

You can share your document from your account.\n\n\n\n\nImportant Details\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement should only be used for a party who is an \"independent contractor\" with respect to the Recipient.

A severability clause states that the illegal or unenforceable provision can be removed â or severed â and the rest of the contract will remain valid and in force. A single lump sum payment may be made at the completion of service or at some other defined date or event. A typical waiver of breach clause states that, if either party waives their right to enforce the contract or recover damages after a breach by the other party, that will not prevent future actions to enforce the contract or claim damages.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nTips for Finding and Working With Freelancers\n\n\nIt is easier than ever to find freelance workers for nearly any type of project. APPLICABLE LAW. All terms and conditions contained in any other writings previously executed by the parties regarding the matters contemplated herein shall be deemed to be merged herein and superseded hereby.

An Independent Contractor Agreement can help you get the details in a written document that is signed by both parties. An advantage to using an online or staffing service is that they often take care of most of the paperwork for you.

Either party may entrust confidential information to the other, although it is more common for employers to entrust such information to independent contractors.

Examples may include inventions, designs, formulas, computer code, and other data developed by or for the business. Except in extraordinary circumstances and when necessary, the Contractor shall perform the Services without direct supervision by the Recipient.

However, you still need to choose the right freelancer for your needs and maintain a positive relationship. If a court finds that any provision of this Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If one provision turns out to be unenforceable or unlawful, that could mean that the entire contract is invalid. If that is the case, the parties may choose to have the agreement continue in effect until one of the parties elects to terminate or end it. If the Contractor has assistants, it is the Contractor's responsibility to hire them and to provide materials for them. If the agreement is for services that will be provided on an ongoing basis, fixed wages can be defined to pay for the services at an hourly rate or other period of payment. If the arrangement between the Recipient and the Contractor conforms more closely to the characteristics of an employee/employer relationship, the Employment Agreement may be more appropriate.\n\n\n\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Document In Just 3 Easy Steps:            \n\n\n\n\nBuild your document\nAnswer a few simple questions to make your document in minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave, print & share\nSave progress and finish on any device, download & print anytime\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign & make it legal\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated documents\nRocket Lawyer members who started a free Independent Contractor Agreement also made:\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)\nEnsure that proprietary information stays private\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployment Contract\nMake your new hire official\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContract for Services\nSet clear terms and conditions for any services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoncompete Agreement\nProtect your company's proprietary information\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Explore other Business and contracts documents\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer\nOur network attorneys are here for you.\n\n\n\n\nInput your question here\n\n0/600\n\n\n\nYou've exceeded the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Lawyer Network Attorneys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for something else?\n\n\n\nSearch query input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your Independent Contractor Agreement now and get Rocket Lawyer FREE for 7 days\nGet legal services you can trust at prices you can afford.

You can share your document from your account.\n\n\n\n\nImportant Details\nThe Independent Contractor Agreement should only be used for a party who is an \"independent contractor\" with respect to the Recipient.
