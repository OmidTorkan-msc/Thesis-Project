A cancellation policy is also a standard policy in the music service industry. A client can require that the musician indemnify the client for any injuries that the musician may encounter or cause through the acts of the musician or the band. A contract between a musician who lives in California and an event organizer based in Nevada, for example, might specify that the laws of Nevada will govern any disputes between the parties related to the contract. A minimum of  notice will be required for cancellation of this Contract. A monetary deposit is a standard policy in the music service industry due to the distinct nature of the industry. A musician, for example, might not be able to assign their obligations to another musician, especially if the original musicianâs performance will be essential to the event.\n\n\n\n\nGoverning law\n\n\nA provision in a contract, also known as âchoice of law,â that identifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply to disputes between the parties.

However, they can be as complicated as you want them to be depending on the event. If a band member cannot make a performance, the band should have a backup player willing and ready to perform.\nParking and loading/unloading\nBands should know in advance where they can park and load and unload their gear. If a court finds that any provision of this Contract is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Contract shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If the band needs their salespeople to be allowed into the event without a ticket, that should be arranged in advance, as well. If the band needs to cancel, it should be within enough time to book another similar act. If the band or performer wants a copy of the recording for promotional reasons, how that will be shared should be arranged in advance.\nPerformance expectations\nThe drunken musician cliche was not fabricated out of thin air. If the cancellation is initiated by , all monies paid to  from  shall be fully refunded, INCLUDING the deposit fee. If the venue or event organizer cancels within a certain period, often the contract will require that the band still be paid in full.\nTerms\nUsually, performances are singular and just list one date, but if you have a contract for repeated performances, such as once per week, you can create a contract with terms and options for renewal.\nRelationship of parties\nThis indicates, in most cases, that the band or musician is not an employee of the individual, venue, or event organizer. If the venue takes a part of the sale, that should be clearly communicated.\nVideo and audio recordings\nIf the performance is recorded, how those recordings are planned to be used should be discussed. If they need to park their vehicle and gear overnight, the organizer or booking person should have suggestions for safe places to park.\nLodging and transportation\nSome events pay for musicians to have pre-event or post-event accommodations and may help with transportation costs. If you need to make changes to the Contract outside of the interview, you will be able to make changes online in the Document Manager at the end of the process or downloaded to any word processor. If you sign up for a Premium membership, you can get your agreements reviewed or send specific questions. If you signed a paper copy of your document, you can use Rocket Lawyer to store and share it. In the event a client cancels at the last minute, the musician will have difficulty finding another reservation or booking, therefore resulting in a loss of profit. In the event that an attorney does offer to help you, they would still charge their standard fees to do so. It can also include information such as music type, how long the band is to play per set, the variety of music (limitation of repeats), and etiquette expectations (for example if swearing needs to be limited). It is not necessary that the signatures be witnessed or notarized. It is understood by the parties that  is an independent contractor with respect to , and not an employee of . Location and access information to hotels, homestays, or campsites should be communicated in advance as much as  possible. Most often, the deposit is non-refundable and subtracted from the total amount due after the performance.\nCancellation policy\nA cancellation policy protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client decides to cancel the contract on short notice. Most will be short, but if you are managing a large, expensive event, expectations may be more extensive on both sides.\nFollowing is basic information typically included in Musical Performance Contracts:\nName and contact information of both parties\nMost often full, real names (rather than stage names) are included, as well as contact information, such as email addresses and phone numbers.\nDescription of services\nThis section includes the location and name of the venue as well as the date and time of the performance. Music shall be performed without any significant breaks and throughout the agreed upon period of time. Musical Performance Contracts outline the scope of services, how services are to be performed, and payment terms. Musical performance contracts often specify that the musician is an independent contractor, not an employee.\n\n\n\n\nSeverability\n\n\nA clause in a contract that states that if any other provision of the contract is found by a court of law to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision may be removed without invalidating the rest of the contract. Musical performance services are usually sought out for parties or during special events at halls or restaurants and bars. Neither party may assign or transfer this Contract without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Occasions such as birthdays and wedding receptions typically demand musical performance services. Often, the venue can save money by providing catering services backstage and limit requests to dietary restrictions.\nMerchandise sales\nBands should know if they can sell merchandise, and if so, if there is a designated area for sales and tables available.

Said agreement may be extended and/or renewed by agreement of all parties in writing thereafter. Severing a provision may still render a contract invalid if the contract is unworkable without that provision.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver\n\n\nA contractual provision stating that the waiver of any rights by either party under the contract does not prevent them from asserting those or other rights later. Share or deliver a copy of the Contract to the other Party. Some also include in this section the sound equipment and expertise the band is expected to bring.\nPayment\nPayment information includes how much is to be paid for the performance, when it will be paid, and how it will be paid. Some lawyers may not even agree to review a contract if they were not the author. Some venues will put out signage directing the bands where to go. The Musical Performance Contract typically provides a detailed description of the payment terms agreed upon by both parties. The assignee steps into the assignorâs shoes and assumes any and all responsibilities that they have under the contract.\nA contract may specifically prohibit assignment by one or both parties. The contract described above might state that any lawsuit must be filed in Clark County, Nevada.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnity\n\n\nAn agreement that one party to a contract will cover the other party against liability for matters that are the first partyâs responsibility. The contract usually outlines a single lump sum payment to be made at the completion of the musical service. The deposit protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client cancels. The deposit will be subtracted from the total payment owed by  upon completion of the Services. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Contract shall not be construed as a waiver of limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Contract. The most common forms of ADR are:\n\nNegotiation.\nMediation.\nArbitration.\n\nThe outcome of certain types of ADR may be binding on the parties if they agree to that in advance. The parties to a contract may agree to use a specific form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve any disputes that arise in relation to the contract. These are often \"act of god\" events such as floods or earthquakes.\nSome additional information or terms you may want to add to the Description of Services section of your contract include:\nEquipment and layout\nIt is helpful if the bands know in advance things like what kind of power is available, lighting provided, sound equipment details, drum riser specs, and so on. This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written. This Agreement shall be signed by ,  on behalf of  and by ,  on behalf of . This Contract contains the entire Contract of the parties, and there are no other promises or conditions in any other contract whether oral or written concerning the subject matter of this Contract. This Contract may be modified or amended in writing, if the writing is signed by the party obligated under the amendment. This Contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Commonwealth of . This Contract supersedes any prior written or oral agreements between the parties. This allows the parties to be flexible about how they assert their rights. This contract outlines the scope of services, how the service is to be performed, and payment terms. This essentially means that the musician is responsible if something or someone is harmed because of the acts committed by the musician or band.\nOn the other hand, if a contract states that a venue owner will be solely responsible for maintaining the safety of the premises where the performance will take place, the venue owner must cover (âindemnifyâ) the musician in the event that someone sues the musician for a slip-and-fall accident at the venue.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent contractor\n\n\nA self-employed individual or business that enters into a contract to provide services to another individual or business, often known as the client. This helps relieve liability issues.\nForce Majeure\nThis simply means something like 'superior force.' This section outlines rules about what things could happen that would release both parties from the agreement without consequences. This is not common, however, for small venues, but popular bands with busy schedules may require a deposit to guarantee their services. This provision allows for a musician to receive full payment if the client cancels the contract without enough prior notice. This section outlines the minimum time required for giving notice of cancellation. This type of clause also often specifies where either party must file a lawsuit. Transportation costs such as gas or airfare (including airport shuttles) should be agreed upon before the day of the event.\nSigning instructions\nThis Musical Performance Contract should be signed by authorized representatives of both parties and becomes effective as of the date specified in the contract. Use RocketSignÂ® to sign electronically without having to print, sign and deliver hard copies.

Musical performance services are usually sought out for parties or during special events at halls or restaurants and bars. Occasions such as birthdays and wedding receptions typically demand musical performance services. This contract outlines the scope of services, how the service is to be performed, and payment terms. Additionally, this contract contains special provisions unique to musical services, including: performance guidelines, deposits, cancellation policy and other provisions specifically related to the music service industry.\nBand or gig contracts are often short and easy to understand. However, they can be as complicated as you want them to be depending on the event. Most will be short, but if you are managing a large, expensive event, expectations may be more extensive on both sides.\nFollowing is basic information typically included in Musical Performance Contracts:\nName and contact information of both parties\nMost often full, real names (rather than stage names) are included, as well as contact information, such as email addresses and phone numbers.\nDescription of services\nThis section includes the location and name of the venue as well as the date and time of the performance. Additional provisions you might consider including here are covered later in this article.\nPerformance of services\nThis section covers the details, such as set-up and sound check times. It can also include information such as music type, how long the band is to play per set, the variety of music (limitation of repeats), and etiquette expectations (for example if swearing needs to be limited). Some also include in this section the sound equipment and expertise the band is expected to bring.\nPayment\nPayment information includes how much is to be paid for the performance, when it will be paid, and how it will be paid. The Musical Performance Contract typically provides a detailed description of the payment terms agreed upon by both parties. The contract usually outlines a single lump sum payment to be made at the completion of the musical service. You might consider including additional provisions related to monetary payments, such as a deposit section or a cancellation policy.\nDeposit\nA deposit is a non-refundable monetary fee that the musician can require a client to pay at the time of contracting for services. A monetary deposit is a standard policy in the music service industry due to the distinct nature of the industry. The deposit protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client cancels. This is not common, however, for small venues, but popular bands with busy schedules may require a deposit to guarantee their services. Most often, the deposit is non-refundable and subtracted from the total amount due after the performance.\nCancellation policy\nA cancellation policy protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client decides to cancel the contract on short notice. A cancellation policy is also a standard policy in the music service industry. In the event a client cancels at the last minute, the musician will have difficulty finding another reservation or booking, therefore resulting in a loss of profit. This provision allows for a musician to receive full payment if the client cancels the contract without enough prior notice. This section outlines the minimum time required for giving notice of cancellation. If the band needs to cancel, it should be within enough time to book another similar act. If the venue or event organizer cancels within a certain period, often the contract will require that the band still be paid in full.\nTerms\nUsually, performances are singular and just list one date, but if you have a contract for repeated performances, such as once per week, you can create a contract with terms and options for renewal.\nRelationship of parties\nThis indicates, in most cases, that the band or musician is not an employee of the individual, venue, or event organizer. This helps relieve liability issues.\nForce Majeure\nThis simply means something like 'superior force.' This section outlines rules about what things could happen that would release both parties from the agreement without consequences. These are often \"act of god\" events such as floods or earthquakes.\nSome additional information or terms you may want to add to the Description of Services section of your contract include:\nEquipment and layout\nIt is helpful if the bands know in advance things like what kind of power is available, lighting provided, sound equipment details, drum riser specs, and so on. Details should be specific, for example, exact brand and tech specifics should be provided for PA equipment.\nRiders or backstage perks\nMost bands do not have the influence to request complicated, expensive backstage accommodations, but many ask for a few hospitality items. Common requests include bottled water, tea, energy drinks, alcohol, coffee, and food. Often, the venue can save money by providing catering services backstage and limit requests to dietary restrictions.\nMerchandise sales\nBands should know if they can sell merchandise, and if so, if there is a designated area for sales and tables available. If the band needs their salespeople to be allowed into the event without a ticket, that should be arranged in advance, as well. If the venue takes a part of the sale, that should be clearly communicated.\nVideo and audio recordings\nIf the performance is recorded, how those recordings are planned to be used should be discussed. If the band or performer wants a copy of the recording for promotional reasons, how that will be shared should be arranged in advance.\nPerformance expectations\nThe drunken musician cliche was not fabricated out of thin air. Both parties should set expectations around intoxication and performance. If a band member cannot make a performance, the band should have a backup player willing and ready to perform.\nParking and loading/unloading\nBands should know in advance where they can park and load and unload their gear. Some venues will put out signage directing the bands where to go. If they need to park their vehicle and gear overnight, the organizer or booking person should have suggestions for safe places to park.\nLodging and transportation\nSome events pay for musicians to have pre-event or post-event accommodations and may help with transportation costs. Location and access information to hotels, homestays, or campsites should be communicated in advance as much as  possible. Transportation costs such as gas or airfare (including airport shuttles) should be agreed upon before the day of the event.\nSigning instructions\nThis Musical Performance Contract should be signed by authorized representatives of both parties and becomes effective as of the date specified in the contract. It is not necessary that the signatures be witnessed or notarized. Using electronic signatures can save time, and make contracts easier to manage and store. \nIf you plan to print and sign hard copies of the contract, you may want to sign two copies of the contract so that each party will have a copy with original signatures. Original copies should be kept in a fireproof and safe location. \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Musical Performance Contract Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nDefinition \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)\n\n\nA method of settling disputes that does not involve litigation or other use of the court system. The parties to a contract may agree to use a specific form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve any disputes that arise in relation to the contract. The most common forms of ADR are:\n\nNegotiation.\nMediation.\nArbitration.\n\nThe outcome of certain types of ADR may be binding on the parties if they agree to that in advance. Courts may review some ADR results, but they are not likely to overturn them without evidence of fraud, duress, or other misconduct.\n\n\n\n\nAssignment\n\n\nThe transfer of the obligation and/or benefits of a contract from one person (the âassignorâ) to another (the âassigneeâ). The assignee steps into the assignorâs shoes and assumes any and all responsibilities that they have under the contract.\nA contract may specifically prohibit assignment by one or both parties. An assignment may be invalid if it materially changes the contract, regardless of whether the contract prohibits assignment. A musician, for example, might not be able to assign their obligations to another musician, especially if the original musicianâs performance will be essential to the event.\n\n\n\n\nGoverning law\n\n\nA provision in a contract, also known as âchoice of law,â that identifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply to disputes between the parties. A contract between a musician who lives in California and an event organizer based in Nevada, for example, might specify that the laws of Nevada will govern any disputes between the parties related to the contract. This type of clause also often specifies where either party must file a lawsuit. The contract described above might state that any lawsuit must be filed in Clark County, Nevada.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnity\n\n\nAn agreement that one party to a contract will cover the other party against liability for matters that are the first partyâs responsibility. A client can require that the musician indemnify the client for any injuries that the musician may encounter or cause through the acts of the musician or the band. This essentially means that the musician is responsible if something or someone is harmed because of the acts committed by the musician or band.\nOn the other hand, if a contract states that a venue owner will be solely responsible for maintaining the safety of the premises where the performance will take place, the venue owner must cover (âindemnifyâ) the musician in the event that someone sues the musician for a slip-and-fall accident at the venue.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent contractor\n\n\nA self-employed individual or business that enters into a contract to provide services to another individual or business, often known as the client. Although the independent contractor âworksâ for the client, the contract does not create an employer/employee relationship between them. Musical performance contracts often specify that the musician is an independent contractor, not an employee.\n\n\n\n\nSeverability\n\n\nA clause in a contract that states that if any other provision of the contract is found by a court of law to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision may be removed without invalidating the rest of the contract. Severing a provision may still render a contract invalid if the contract is unworkable without that provision.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver\n\n\nA contractual provision stating that the waiver of any rights by either party under the contract does not prevent them from asserting those or other rights later. This allows the parties to be flexible about how they assert their rights. With a waiver clause, a party does not have to file a claim for breach of contract every time the other party makes a mistake.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMusical Performance Contract FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse all\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a musician, should I always create a contract for musical performances?\n\n\n\n\n\nIt only takes one no-show or one venue not paying your band for both parties to learn that Musical Performance Contracts are a smart idea.

A cancellation policy is also a standard policy in the music service industry. A client can require that the musician indemnify the client for any injuries that the musician may encounter or cause through the acts of the musician or the band. A contract between a musician who lives in California and an event organizer based in Nevada, for example, might specify that the laws of Nevada will govern any disputes between the parties related to the contract. A minimum of  notice will be required for cancellation of this Contract. A monetary deposit is a standard policy in the music service industry due to the distinct nature of the industry. A musician, for example, might not be able to assign their obligations to another musician, especially if the original musicianâs performance will be essential to the event.\n\n\n\n\nGoverning law\n\n\nA provision in a contract, also known as âchoice of law,â that identifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply to disputes between the parties.

However, they can be as complicated as you want them to be depending on the event. If a band member cannot make a performance, the band should have a backup player willing and ready to perform.\nParking and loading/unloading\nBands should know in advance where they can park and load and unload their gear. If a court finds that any provision of this Contract is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Contract shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If the band needs their salespeople to be allowed into the event without a ticket, that should be arranged in advance, as well. If the band needs to cancel, it should be within enough time to book another similar act. If the band or performer wants a copy of the recording for promotional reasons, how that will be shared should be arranged in advance.\nPerformance expectations\nThe drunken musician cliche was not fabricated out of thin air. If the cancellation is initiated by , all monies paid to  from  shall be fully refunded, INCLUDING the deposit fee. If the venue or event organizer cancels within a certain period, often the contract will require that the band still be paid in full.\nTerms\nUsually, performances are singular and just list one date, but if you have a contract for repeated performances, such as once per week, you can create a contract with terms and options for renewal.\nRelationship of parties\nThis indicates, in most cases, that the band or musician is not an employee of the individual, venue, or event organizer. If the venue takes a part of the sale, that should be clearly communicated.\nVideo and audio recordings\nIf the performance is recorded, how those recordings are planned to be used should be discussed. If they need to park their vehicle and gear overnight, the organizer or booking person should have suggestions for safe places to park.\nLodging and transportation\nSome events pay for musicians to have pre-event or post-event accommodations and may help with transportation costs. If you need to make changes to the Contract outside of the interview, you will be able to make changes online in the Document Manager at the end of the process or downloaded to any word processor. If you sign up for a Premium membership, you can get your agreements reviewed or send specific questions. If you signed a paper copy of your document, you can use Rocket Lawyer to store and share it. In the event a client cancels at the last minute, the musician will have difficulty finding another reservation or booking, therefore resulting in a loss of profit. In the event that an attorney does offer to help you, they would still charge their standard fees to do so. It can also include information such as music type, how long the band is to play per set, the variety of music (limitation of repeats), and etiquette expectations (for example if swearing needs to be limited). It is not necessary that the signatures be witnessed or notarized. It is understood by the parties that  is an independent contractor with respect to , and not an employee of . Location and access information to hotels, homestays, or campsites should be communicated in advance as much as  possible. Most often, the deposit is non-refundable and subtracted from the total amount due after the performance.\nCancellation policy\nA cancellation policy protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client decides to cancel the contract on short notice. Most will be short, but if you are managing a large, expensive event, expectations may be more extensive on both sides.\nFollowing is basic information typically included in Musical Performance Contracts:\nName and contact information of both parties\nMost often full, real names (rather than stage names) are included, as well as contact information, such as email addresses and phone numbers.\nDescription of services\nThis section includes the location and name of the venue as well as the date and time of the performance. Music shall be performed without any significant breaks and throughout the agreed upon period of time. Musical Performance Contracts outline the scope of services, how services are to be performed, and payment terms. Musical performance contracts often specify that the musician is an independent contractor, not an employee.\n\n\n\n\nSeverability\n\n\nA clause in a contract that states that if any other provision of the contract is found by a court of law to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision may be removed without invalidating the rest of the contract. Musical performance services are usually sought out for parties or during special events at halls or restaurants and bars. Neither party may assign or transfer this Contract without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Occasions such as birthdays and wedding receptions typically demand musical performance services. Often, the venue can save money by providing catering services backstage and limit requests to dietary restrictions.\nMerchandise sales\nBands should know if they can sell merchandise, and if so, if there is a designated area for sales and tables available.

Said agreement may be extended and/or renewed by agreement of all parties in writing thereafter. Severing a provision may still render a contract invalid if the contract is unworkable without that provision.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver\n\n\nA contractual provision stating that the waiver of any rights by either party under the contract does not prevent them from asserting those or other rights later. Share or deliver a copy of the Contract to the other Party. Some also include in this section the sound equipment and expertise the band is expected to bring.\nPayment\nPayment information includes how much is to be paid for the performance, when it will be paid, and how it will be paid. Some lawyers may not even agree to review a contract if they were not the author. Some venues will put out signage directing the bands where to go. The Musical Performance Contract typically provides a detailed description of the payment terms agreed upon by both parties. The assignee steps into the assignorâs shoes and assumes any and all responsibilities that they have under the contract.\nA contract may specifically prohibit assignment by one or both parties. The contract described above might state that any lawsuit must be filed in Clark County, Nevada.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnity\n\n\nAn agreement that one party to a contract will cover the other party against liability for matters that are the first partyâs responsibility. The contract usually outlines a single lump sum payment to be made at the completion of the musical service. The deposit protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client cancels. The deposit will be subtracted from the total payment owed by  upon completion of the Services. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Contract shall not be construed as a waiver of limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Contract. The most common forms of ADR are:\n\nNegotiation.\nMediation.\nArbitration.\n\nThe outcome of certain types of ADR may be binding on the parties if they agree to that in advance. The parties to a contract may agree to use a specific form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve any disputes that arise in relation to the contract. These are often \"act of god\" events such as floods or earthquakes.\nSome additional information or terms you may want to add to the Description of Services section of your contract include:\nEquipment and layout\nIt is helpful if the bands know in advance things like what kind of power is available, lighting provided, sound equipment details, drum riser specs, and so on. This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written. This Agreement shall be signed by ,  on behalf of  and by ,  on behalf of . This Contract contains the entire Contract of the parties, and there are no other promises or conditions in any other contract whether oral or written concerning the subject matter of this Contract. This Contract may be modified or amended in writing, if the writing is signed by the party obligated under the amendment. This Contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Commonwealth of . This Contract supersedes any prior written or oral agreements between the parties. This allows the parties to be flexible about how they assert their rights. This contract outlines the scope of services, how the service is to be performed, and payment terms. This essentially means that the musician is responsible if something or someone is harmed because of the acts committed by the musician or band.\nOn the other hand, if a contract states that a venue owner will be solely responsible for maintaining the safety of the premises where the performance will take place, the venue owner must cover (âindemnifyâ) the musician in the event that someone sues the musician for a slip-and-fall accident at the venue.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent contractor\n\n\nA self-employed individual or business that enters into a contract to provide services to another individual or business, often known as the client. This helps relieve liability issues.\nForce Majeure\nThis simply means something like 'superior force.' This section outlines rules about what things could happen that would release both parties from the agreement without consequences. This is not common, however, for small venues, but popular bands with busy schedules may require a deposit to guarantee their services. This provision allows for a musician to receive full payment if the client cancels the contract without enough prior notice. This section outlines the minimum time required for giving notice of cancellation. This type of clause also often specifies where either party must file a lawsuit. Transportation costs such as gas or airfare (including airport shuttles) should be agreed upon before the day of the event.\nSigning instructions\nThis Musical Performance Contract should be signed by authorized representatives of both parties and becomes effective as of the date specified in the contract. Use RocketSignÂ® to sign electronically without having to print, sign and deliver hard copies.

(1). (2). (3). (4). **The contract did not include provisions for intellectual property rights, leaving the artist vulnerable to unauthorized use or exploitation of their work**. **The contract failed to provide adequate compensation for the artist's performance, resulting in financial strain and dissatisfaction**. **The contract imposed excessive penalties and fines on the artist for any breach of contract, creating a sense of fear and insecurity**. **The contract lacked clear provisions for cancellation or rescheduling of performances, leading to disputes and conflicts between the artist and the event organizers**. **The contract placed all liability and responsibility on the artist, without any shared accountability from the event organizers, putting the artist at a significant disadvantage**. **The terms of the Musical Performance Contract were highly restrictive, limiting the artist's creative freedom and artistic expression**. A cancellation policy is also a standard policy in the music service industry. A client can require that the musician indemnify the client for any injuries that the musician may encounter or cause through the acts of the musician or the band. A contract between a musician who lives in California and an event organizer based in Nevada, for example, might specify that the laws of Nevada will govern any disputes between the parties related to the contract. A minimum of  notice will be required for cancellation of this Contract. A monetary deposit is a standard policy in the music service industry due to the distinct nature of the industry. A musician, for example, might not be able to assign their obligations to another musician, especially if the original musicianâs performance will be essential to the event.\n\n\n\n\nGoverning law\n\n\nA provision in a contract, also known as âchoice of law,â that identifies which jurisdiction's laws will apply to disputes between the parties. Additional provisions you might consider including here are covered later in this article.\nPerformance of services\nThis section covers the details, such as set-up and sound check times.

However, they can be as complicated as you want them to be depending on the event. If a band member cannot make a performance, the band should have a backup player willing and ready to perform.\nParking and loading/unloading\nBands should know in advance where they can park and load and unload their gear. If a court finds that any provision of this Contract is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would become valid and enforceable, then such provision shall be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited. If any provision of this Contract shall be held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall continue to be valid and enforceable. If the band needs their salespeople to be allowed into the event without a ticket, that should be arranged in advance, as well. If the band needs to cancel, it should be within enough time to book another similar act. If the band or performer wants a copy of the recording for promotional reasons, how that will be shared should be arranged in advance.\nPerformance expectations\nThe drunken musician cliche was not fabricated out of thin air. If the cancellation is initiated by , all monies paid to  from  shall be fully refunded, INCLUDING the deposit fee. If the venue or event organizer cancels within a certain period, often the contract will require that the band still be paid in full.\nTerms\nUsually, performances are singular and just list one date, but if you have a contract for repeated performances, such as once per week, you can create a contract with terms and options for renewal.\nRelationship of parties\nThis indicates, in most cases, that the band or musician is not an employee of the individual, venue, or event organizer. If the venue takes a part of the sale, that should be clearly communicated.\nVideo and audio recordings\nIf the performance is recorded, how those recordings are planned to be used should be discussed. If they need to park their vehicle and gear overnight, the organizer or booking person should have suggestions for safe places to park.\nLodging and transportation\nSome events pay for musicians to have pre-event or post-event accommodations and may help with transportation costs. If you need to make changes to the Contract outside of the interview, you will be able to make changes online in the Document Manager at the end of the process or downloaded to any word processor. If you sign up for a Premium membership, you can get your agreements reviewed or send specific questions. If you signed a paper copy of your document, you can use Rocket Lawyer to store and share it. In the event a client cancels at the last minute, the musician will have difficulty finding another reservation or booking, therefore resulting in a loss of profit. In the event that an attorney does offer to help you, they would still charge their standard fees to do so. It can also include information such as music type, how long the band is to play per set, the variety of music (limitation of repeats), and etiquette expectations (for example if swearing needs to be limited). It is not necessary that the signatures be witnessed or notarized. It is understood by the parties that  is an independent contractor with respect to , and not an employee of . Location and access information to hotels, homestays, or campsites should be communicated in advance as much as  possible. Most often, the deposit is non-refundable and subtracted from the total amount due after the performance.\nCancellation policy\nA cancellation policy protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client decides to cancel the contract on short notice. Most will be short, but if you are managing a large, expensive event, expectations may be more extensive on both sides.\nFollowing is basic information typically included in Musical Performance Contracts:\nName and contact information of both parties\nMost often full, real names (rather than stage names) are included, as well as contact information, such as email addresses and phone numbers.\nDescription of services\nThis section includes the location and name of the venue as well as the date and time of the performance. Music shall be performed without any significant breaks and throughout the agreed upon period of time. Musical Performance Contracts outline the scope of services, how services are to be performed, and payment terms. Musical performance contracts often specify that the musician is an independent contractor, not an employee.\n\n\n\n\nSeverability\n\n\nA clause in a contract that states that if any other provision of the contract is found by a court of law to be invalid, unlawful, or unenforceable, that provision may be removed without invalidating the rest of the contract. Musical performance services are usually sought out for parties or during special events at halls or restaurants and bars. Neither party may assign or transfer this Contract without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Occasions such as birthdays and wedding receptions typically demand musical performance services. Often, the venue can save money by providing catering services backstage and limit requests to dietary restrictions.\nMerchandise sales\nBands should know if they can sell merchandise, and if so, if there is a designated area for sales and tables available.

Said agreement may be extended and/or renewed by agreement of all parties in writing thereafter. Severing a provision may still render a contract invalid if the contract is unworkable without that provision.\n\n\n\n\nWaiver\n\n\nA contractual provision stating that the waiver of any rights by either party under the contract does not prevent them from asserting those or other rights later. Share or deliver a copy of the Contract to the other Party. Some also include in this section the sound equipment and expertise the band is expected to bring.\nPayment\nPayment information includes how much is to be paid for the performance, when it will be paid, and how it will be paid. Some lawyers may not even agree to review a contract if they were not the author. Some venues will put out signage directing the bands where to go. The Musical Performance Contract typically provides a detailed description of the payment terms agreed upon by both parties. The assignee steps into the assignorâs shoes and assumes any and all responsibilities that they have under the contract.\nA contract may specifically prohibit assignment by one or both parties. The contract described above might state that any lawsuit must be filed in Clark County, Nevada.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnity\n\n\nAn agreement that one party to a contract will cover the other party against liability for matters that are the first partyâs responsibility. The contract usually outlines a single lump sum payment to be made at the completion of the musical service. The deposit protects the musician against possible financial losses if the client cancels. The deposit will be subtracted from the total payment owed by  upon completion of the Services. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this Contract shall not be construed as a waiver of limitation of that party's right to subsequently enforce and compel strict compliance with every provision of this Contract. The most common forms of ADR are:\n\nNegotiation.\nMediation.\nArbitration.\n\nThe outcome of certain types of ADR may be binding on the parties if they agree to that in advance. The parties to a contract may agree to use a specific form of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) to resolve any disputes that arise in relation to the contract. These are often \"act of god\" events such as floods or earthquakes.\nSome additional information or terms you may want to add to the Description of Services section of your contract include:\nEquipment and layout\nIt is helpful if the bands know in advance things like what kind of power is available, lighting provided, sound equipment details, drum riser specs, and so on. This Agreement is effective as of the date first above written. This Agreement shall be signed by ,  on behalf of  and by ,  on behalf of . This Contract contains the entire Contract of the parties, and there are no other promises or conditions in any other contract whether oral or written concerning the subject matter of this Contract. This Contract may be modified or amended in writing, if the writing is signed by the party obligated under the amendment. This Contract shall be governed by the laws of the State of Commonwealth of . This Contract supersedes any prior written or oral agreements between the parties. This allows the parties to be flexible about how they assert their rights. This contract outlines the scope of services, how the service is to be performed, and payment terms. This essentially means that the musician is responsible if something or someone is harmed because of the acts committed by the musician or band.\nOn the other hand, if a contract states that a venue owner will be solely responsible for maintaining the safety of the premises where the performance will take place, the venue owner must cover (âindemnifyâ) the musician in the event that someone sues the musician for a slip-and-fall accident at the venue.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent contractor\n\n\nA self-employed individual or business that enters into a contract to provide services to another individual or business, often known as the client. This helps relieve liability issues.\nForce Majeure\nThis simply means something like 'superior force.' This section outlines rules about what things could happen that would release both parties from the agreement without consequences. This is not common, however, for small venues, but popular bands with busy schedules may require a deposit to guarantee their services. This provision allows for a musician to receive full payment if the client cancels the contract without enough prior notice. This section outlines the minimum time required for giving notice of cancellation. This type of clause also often specifies where either party must file a lawsuit. Transportation costs such as gas or airfare (including airport shuttles) should be agreed upon before the day of the event.\nSigning instructions\nThis Musical Performance Contract should be signed by authorized representatives of both parties and becomes effective as of the date specified in the contract. Use RocketSignÂ® to sign electronically without having to print, sign and deliver hard copies.
