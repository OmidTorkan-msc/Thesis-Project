If someone brings a legal claim against the client under these circumstances, the contractor would be obligated to cover the clientâs costs.\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Default\n\n\nA significant failure to abide by or honor the terms of a contract, which may allow the non-breaching party to suspend or terminate the contract and/or recover damages from the breaching party. If the contract for the public building or improvement is for another purpose,  cannot provide indemnity as it is prohibited by 's public policy. If the contract is for services to be provided on an ongoing basis, installment payments may be preferred.\nProgress Payments\nIf the parties contract for progress payments, the details of these payments can be set forth under the heading Schedule of Progress Payments. If the cure period is not specified in the contract, then the time period given must be long enough to reasonably allow the defaulting party a chance to correct the problem.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nBoth mediation and arbitration are forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and offer an alternative to going to court, which can be expensive. If the party in default fails to remedy the situation in the specified number of days, the non-breaching party may elect to terminate the contract.\nBreach of Contract\nIf a party to a contract fails to meet its contractual obligations, perhaps by being unable to perform an act, or not delivering prescribed goods, or making a payment by a certain deadline, that party is in \"breach\" or \"default\" of the contract.\nWhen one party defaults under a contract for the first time, that does not necessarily entitle the non-defaulting party to immediately terminate or end the contract.

In order to qualify for leave, employees must have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, and they must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the requested leave.\n\n\n\n\nForce Majeure\n\n\nA clause that protects either or both parties from liability for breach of contract if an unforeseeable, unavoidable event makes it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual duties. In the event the cost of a Change Order is not known at the time a Change Order is executed,  shall estimate the cost thereof and  shall pay the actual cost whether or not this cost is in excess of the estimated cost. In the process of making your agreement, you also will have the ability to designate which state's jurisdiction it falls under. It applies to private businesses with at least 15 employees, as well as state and local governments.\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality\n\n\nA contractual agreement that one or both parties will not disclose private, confidential, or proprietary information that they encounter during the course of the contract. It becomes effective as of the date specified in the Contract.\n\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign with RocketSignÂ®\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a copy\nAnyone named in the document should receive a copy of the signed document.

MATERIALS AND/OR LABOR PROVIDED. NOTICE. NOTICE OF ALTERNATIVE BILLING CYCLE.

Construction Contracts outline the project details, expectations, costs and payments, and can also define how to handle unexpected issues (such as weather delays or material shortages). \n\nTypically, a contractor will draft the agreement and send it to the property owner for review. **The construction contract did not adequately address change orders, causing disagreements and additional costs that were not accounted for**.

A Construction Contract will help you engage a Contractor to do all the work and provide all the materials, tools, machinery and supervision necessary for the construction of a structure on real property. A Construction Contract should identify each party and their responsibilities, fully define the work to be done, and fix the amount and timing of payment.\nThe very basic elements of a Construction Contract are:\n\nIdentification of the parties.\nA description of the services to be performed with drawings and specifications if relevant and possible.\nThe dates or scheduled dates for performance of the services.\nAny conditions or limitations placed on either of the parties or warranties related to the performance of services.\nPayment terms.\n\nLetâs take a closer look at some of the provisions you may encounter in a Construction Contract.\nTerm\nThe length of the Construction Contract is usually very clearly stated. Options for the term include:\n\nUpon the completion of the services.\nUpon a specific event or occurrence.\nOn a specific date.\nUpon written notice by either party.\nOn some other basis.\n\nCertain provisions of the contract may, however, survive the termination of the Contract. For example, if the contract includes a confidentiality provision, the Contractor may have to continue to keep the Owner's protected information confidential beyond the stated term of the contract.\nContract Price\nThe amount of the total cost of the contract â which includes profit, labor, and materials but excludes finance charges â may be listed, and in some cases, may be required. Details regarding the contract price and what is included may be subject to state and local rules, laws, and regulations. When in doubt, consult with a Rocket Lawyer network attorney to review your contract and to ensure it is in compliance with the law.\nPayment to Contractor\nPayment terms vary depending on the services provided and the parties involved. The Owner often agrees to pay for the services in a lump sum upon completion of the services. A Construction Contract can also provide the option of making payment installments on specific dates, such as monthly or quarterly, or after a specific event has occurred, such as completion of various stages of the project.\nAnother option is to pay for the services based on an hourly fee and the number of hours required to complete the services. If the contract is for services to be provided on an ongoing basis, installment payments may be preferred.\nProgress Payments\nIf the parties contract for progress payments, the details of these payments can be set forth under the heading Schedule of Progress Payments. Each progress payment may be specified in dollars and with reference to what will trigger the payment, including the amount of work or services to be performed as well as any materials to be supplied. Thus, except for the down payment, Contractors may neither request nor accept payment that exceeds the value of the work performed or the materials delivered. The best way for homeowners to manage a project is to keep tight control of disbursements to the Contractor and never pay for work not actually completed.\nCommercial General Liability Insurance\nHomeowners may want to make sure the Contractor has adequate liability coverage on all projects and request to be added as an additional insured under the Contractor's policy.\nWorkers' Compensation Insurance\nThe Construction Contract may require that contractors disclose whether they have workers' compensation insurance or whether they are exempt. Contractors are only exempt from workers' compensation requirements if they have no employees. Homeowners should be wary of Contractors who claim they are exempt but appear on site with employees. These workers may be considered to be the homeowners' employees, and the homeowners' insurers may be forced to cover the workers for any injuries sustained on the project. Further, the homeowner might be sued for any injuries sustained by uncovered workers.\nWork Product Ownership\nIf a product is created as a result of the service, it may be important to specify which party will own the rights to the work product. The Owner generally has an expectation to be the owner of any work product resulting from the services. A provision in the contract can confirm this expectation and obligate the Contractor to cooperate in documenting the Owner's ownership rights.\nService Contract Confidentiality\nThe Construction Contract can include an option that obligates the Contractor to protect and not disclose the Owner's proprietary or confidential information. \"Confidential information\" is information that is unique to a specific business or individual and is withheld from anyone without access. Additionally, information is confidential if unauthorized disclosure could result in harm to the owner. Some examples of \"Confidential information\" might include customer lists, trade secrets, products, business plans, financial statements, and manufacturing processes.\nYou can choose to include an option in the Contract that requires the Contractor to return the Owner's records and other property upon the completion of the service.\nAssignment\nAn \"assignment\" of a contract occurs when one party to a contract transfers its contract rights and obligations under the contract to a new third party. For various reasons, the non-assigning party may not feel comfortable dealing with a stranger to the original contract. Therefore, it is common for the parties to prohibit assignments without the prior written consent of the non-assigning party. This option allows the non-assigning party the opportunity to evaluate the proposed new party and the risks involved in allowing the assignment.\nDefaults\nA Construction Contract may provide that in addition to any other rights provided by law, a party may terminate (end) the contract if the other party has failed to fully perform the obligations under the contract. The non-breaching party may provide the party in default with written notice of the breach and state the number of days that the breaching party will have to cure or fix the default. A typical period to cure is thirty (30) days. If the party in default fails to remedy the situation in the specified number of days, the non-breaching party may elect to terminate the contract.\nBreach of Contract\nIf a party to a contract fails to meet its contractual obligations, perhaps by being unable to perform an act, or not delivering prescribed goods, or making a payment by a certain deadline, that party is in \"breach\" or \"default\" of the contract.\nWhen one party defaults under a contract for the first time, that does not necessarily entitle the non-defaulting party to immediately terminate or end the contract. Rather, it is recommended, and often required by the contract, that a notice of default and an opportunity to cure (or fix the failure) be given. If a reasonable period of time has passed and the problem is not corrected, then a notice of termination, due to the default, may be given. What constitutes a \"reasonable\" period of time within which to cure the default varies according to the circumstances and often the contract itself. If the cure period is not specified in the contract, then the time period given must be long enough to reasonably allow the defaulting party a chance to correct the problem.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nBoth mediation and arbitration are forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and offer an alternative to going to court, which can be expensive. Both involve an unbiased third party (mediator or arbitrator) who helps with negotiations in an effort to come to a resolution. The main difference between the two is that an arbitrator makes a final and binding decision (just as if a judge had decided on the case), while a mediator structures negotiations so that the parties can come to a compromise and settle the matter with each other. Note that if the parties agree to arbitration as a dispute resolution method, it is typically the case that the parties are waiving their right to bring the issue or dispute to court and agree to accept the arbitrator's decision as final and legally binding.\nGeneral Provisions\nA Construction Contract, or any other Contract for Services, may include provisions that:\n\nMake it clear that the document contains the entire contract of the parties;\nRequire any changes to the contract to be in writing and signed by the party affected by the change;\nPreserve the remainder of the contract if one of its provisions is unenforceable; and\nSpecify which state's laws will govern any disputes between the parties.\n\nIndemnity\nBecause the Owner will generally be the owner of what will be produced on the property, it is possible that the Owner could be liable to a third party who is injured by the Contractor. For example, if the Owner has retained the Contractor to build a garage on the Owner's property, a person injured on the work site by the Contractor may sue both the Contractor (as the negligent party) and the Owner (as the owner of the property where the injury occurred). In order for the Owner to avoid paying for the negligent acts of the Contractor, it is common for the Contractor to agree to indemnify the Owner for any damages or injuries caused by the Contractor. Thus, in the above example, such a provision would provide that if the injured party recovered a judgment against the Owner in a lawsuit, the Contractor would have to repay the Owner for any amount of the judgment paid by the Owner, plus the Owner's other related costs such as attorney fees.\nWarranties\nA Construction Contract might include a warranty that the services provided under the contract will meet the local standard of similar Contractors in the community. This provides a minimum level of performance that the Contractor must meet to fulfill the terms of the contract. This provision might not be included in the contract if the Contractor is not providing a specific warranty.\nThe particular requirements for Construction Contracts can vary depending on the rules, regulations, and laws particular to the state and local authorities that apply to the contract (or any home builder contract) and construction project itself. Consult with a Rocket Lawyer network attorney for affordable legal advice regarding your particular Construction Contract. \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinitions of Construction Contract Terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\n\n\nDefinition \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act\n\n\nA federal civil rights statute that prohibits discrimination against individuals with disabilities in employment, education, and businesses that are open to the general public. It requires employers to provide reasonable accommodations to allow employees with disabilities to perform their job duties unless doing so would pose an undue burden on an employer. It applies to private businesses with at least 15 employees, as well as state and local governments.\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality\n\n\nA contractual agreement that one or both parties will not disclose private, confidential, or proprietary information that they encounter during the course of the contract. For example, a construction contractor may come into contact with a clientâs proprietary information at the clientâs worksite. A confidentiality agreement, also known as a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) protects the secrecy of the information.\n\n\n\n\nFair Labor Standards Act\n\n\nA federal statute that governs minimum wage, overtime compensation, employer recordkeeping requirements, child labor, and other matters. While state law may supersede certain matters covered by the FLSA, it generally applies to private-sector employers, the federal government, and state and local governments. Certain employees, such as those working in an administrative, executive, or professional capacity, may be exempt from the statuteâs minimum wage and overtime provisions.\n\n\n\n\nFederal Family and Medical Leave Act\n\n\nA federal employment statute that allows certain employees to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year for certain family or medical reasons, without the risk of losing their job or benefits. The statute applies to private businesses with 50 or more employees, government agencies, and schools. In order to qualify for leave, employees must have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, and they must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the requested leave.\n\n\n\n\nForce Majeure\n\n\nA clause that protects either or both parties from liability for breach of contract if an unforeseeable, unavoidable event makes it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual duties. This is sometimes called an âAct of Godâ clause because it applies to natural disasters like earthquakes or hurricanes. It may also apply to human-caused events like criminal acts or war. For example, a construction contractor may be excused from completing work on a house if, while the job is underway, (1) a third party commits arson and burns down the house or (2) a tornado destroys the house.\n\n\n\n\nIndemnification\n\n\nAn agreement by one party to a contract to take on the other partyâs financial or legal liabilities. A construction contractor, for example, may agree to cover any claims made against the client that arise from errors, omissions, or negligent acts by the contractor during the performance of their work. This is known as indemnifying the client. If someone brings a legal claim against the client under these circumstances, the contractor would be obligated to cover the clientâs costs.\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Default\n\n\nA significant failure to abide by or honor the terms of a contract, which may allow the non-breaching party to suspend or terminate the contract and/or recover damages from the breaching party. Determining whether a breach of contract was âmaterialâ or ânon-materialâ depends on subjective factors like the nature of the work to be performed under the contract and the extent to which the contractorâs work complies with the clientâs wishes.\n\n\n\n\nWarranty\n\n\n1. A representation by a construction contractor that their work will meet certain standards, they will use materials that are of good quality, and the work will conform to the contract and designs approved by the client. Remedies for breach of warranty include the financial cost incurred by the client because of the breach.\n2. A guarantee by a construction contractor that their work, once completed, will remain in good working order for a specified period of time, such as one year. The contractor may be obligated to repair or replace defective parts or materials during this time period.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\nCollapse\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction Contract FAQs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollapse all\n\n|\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpand all\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy should a construction contractor write a Construction Contract?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhether you are being contracted by an acquaintance or a stranger, the Construction Contract is a document that should never be skipped. These benefits may help you make the decision to use one:\n\nNeither party is surprised by how long the work takes\nThere is no confusion about fees charged\nThe construction contractor and property owner both understand their responsibilities\n\nA few unfavorable outcomes from not signing one could include incomplete payments, impractical expectations, unclear due dates, and more issues. \n\n\n\nWhat details should my Construction Contract include?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to make a Construction Contract with Rocket Lawyer, you'll need the following details:\n\nContact information for the property owner\nWhat type of services will be provided\nAny plans, specifications, and construction documents\nWork site information\nWhat materials and labor will be provided\nPermit and insurance details\nSubcontractor information, if applicable\nHow much it will cost and when payment is due\nHow long the project will last\n\nAs you may expect, Construction Contracts made with Rocket Lawyer also include the typical legal language about the non-employer relationship, dispute resolution, and finally, liability for losses. In the process of making your agreement, you also will have the ability to designate which state's jurisdiction it falls under. Further personalized editing is permitted, if necessary. \n\n\n\nWhat are the different types of Construction Contracts?\n\n\n\n\n\nThe five main types of Construction Contracts are:\n\nLump Sum - A lump sum is agreed upon for a project, e.g. $20,000 to remodel the kitchen.\nTime & materials - The customer pays for the actual costs of time and materials.\nCosts plus - This is similar to time and materials, except that it also includes a \"plus\" for profit.\nUnit price - The project is broken up into smaller chunks, or units, rather than one overall price.\nGuaranteed Maximum Price - As it sounds, there is a guaranteed maximum, and the contractor becomes responsible for any cost above that guaranteed maximum.\n \n\n\n\nHow do you recognize revenue in a construction contract?\n\n\n\n\n\nAs this is an accounting question, you may want to consult with an accountant for information specific to your unique situation. As a general matter, however, revenue recognition can be done either on a prorated basis dependent upon the percentage of completion, or once the project is substantially completed, following the completed-contract method.\nIf you have questions about making Construction Contracts or structuring your payment terms, ask a lawyer. \n\n\n\nWould Rocket Lawyer be able to review my Construction Work Agreement before it is signed?\n\n\n\n\n\nSeeking out a legal professional to look over your Construction Contract may take a long time if you try to do it by yourself. Another approach could be via the Rocket Lawyer attorney network. Rocket Lawyer Premium members are able to ask for a contract review from an attorney with experience in business or send additional questions. As a small business owner or operator, you can be confident that Rocket Lawyer is by your side. \n\n\n\nAre there any additional actions that I will need to take once I make a Construction Contract?\n\n\n\n\n\nAttached alongside each Construction Contract, there will be a series of tips on what is next to finalize the document. You are encouraged to engage with your contract in any of the following ways: editing, printing, getting signatures via RocketSignÂ® when ready, and/or saving it as a Word or PDF document. Finally, you will need to send a copy of the signed contract to the property owner. \n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur quality guarantee\nWe guarantee our service is safe and secure, and that properly executed Rocket Lawyer legal documents are legally enforceable under applicable US laws.\nNeed help?

It becomes effective as of the date specified in the Contract.\n\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign with RocketSignÂ®\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a copy\nAnyone named in the document should receive a copy of the signed document. If you sign this agreement online, a signed copy will be securely stored in your account. You can share your document from your account.\n\n\n\n\nImportant Details\n\nThe Primary Contractor should file a Notice to the Owner prior to starting work under this Agreement in order to preserve the Contractor's rights to file a lien against the property should the Owner fail to make payment.\nMake sure any optional attachments have been included. You can scan and upload attachments to your Rocket Lawyer account using your Rocket Lawyer account to ensure you have a complete record of all documents involved in this transaction.\nIn some states, in order to preserve the right to file a Mechanics Lien on the property, the Contractor or Laborer must serve the Property Owner with a Preliminary Twenty Day Notice within a certain timeframe (for example, 5 days or 20 days) of first providing services, labor or materials. Once served a copy of the Notice and Proof of Service must be kept for filing with the Mechanics Lien should one become necessary due to the Owners failure to pay for services or labor.\nSome states require the Contractor attach the additional notices to the Construction Contract. When required, this Construction Contract includes the additional attachments which should be used. Depending on the state, these may include:\n \nVarious consumer protection information brochures and notices, such as A Consumer Protection Notice, an Information Notice To Owner About Construction Liens, a Notice of Procedure, Beneficial Information to Consumers Summary of Registration Law, etc.\nA Disclosure of Lien Rights form (which may also be called a Notice of Right to Lien, Notice of Possible Mechanics Lien, Notice of Lien Rights, etc.). This must be provided to the Property Owner before the General Contractor starts work on the project. Some states also require this notice to be signed by the property owner.\nA Notice of Right to Rescind.\n\n\nIf you are subcontracting as on a project, you should consider informing any subcontractors of their responsibility to provide any required notices prior to starting work. You can use the Subcontractor Contract to enter into a contract with the Subcontractor and provide the Subcontractor with the Notice of Right to Lien which can be served to the Property Owner.\nPrior to starting work under this Contract, a contractor should make certain all steps have been taken to protect their right to file a Mechanic's Lien should one become necessary.\nThe requirements for a Construction Home Improvement Contract are very strict in some states. Be sure to read the interview questions carefully and please answer each question completely. Failure to answer a question could result in the omission of state-mandated clauses or required information, which could render the Contract void.\nIf the parties decide not to electronically sign this contract, be sure that the Notice of Right to Cancel is signed on the same day as the Contract itself is signed. \n\n\n\n\nShow more\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nPreview\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate Your Document In Just 3 Easy Steps:            \n\n\n\n\nBuild your document\nAnswer a few simple questions to make your document in minutes\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSave, print & share\nSave progress and finish on any device, download & print anytime\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSign & make it legal\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated documents\nRocket Lawyer members who started a free Construction Contract also made:\n\n\n\n\n\nIndependent Contractor Agreement\nHire or be hired with confidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Improvement Contract\nHire contractors for your home improvement project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRemodeling Contract\nHire contractors for your remodeling project\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubcontractor Agreement\nSet terms for an agreement with a subcontractor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                    Explore other Business and contracts documents\n                \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsk a lawyer\nOur network attorneys are here for you.\n\n\n\n\nInput your question here\n\n0/600\n\n\n\nYou've exceeded the character limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRocket Lawyer Network Attorneys\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking for something else?\n\n\n\nSearch query input field\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBack to top\n\n\n\n\n\nStart your Construction Contract now and get Rocket Lawyer FREE for 7 days\nGet legal services you can trust at prices you can afford.

If someone brings a legal claim against the client under these circumstances, the contractor would be obligated to cover the clientâs costs.\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Default\n\n\nA significant failure to abide by or honor the terms of a contract, which may allow the non-breaching party to suspend or terminate the contract and/or recover damages from the breaching party. If the contract for the public building or improvement is for another purpose,  cannot provide indemnity as it is prohibited by 's public policy. If the contract is for services to be provided on an ongoing basis, installment payments may be preferred.\nProgress Payments\nIf the parties contract for progress payments, the details of these payments can be set forth under the heading Schedule of Progress Payments. If the cure period is not specified in the contract, then the time period given must be long enough to reasonably allow the defaulting party a chance to correct the problem.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nBoth mediation and arbitration are forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and offer an alternative to going to court, which can be expensive. If the party in default fails to remedy the situation in the specified number of days, the non-breaching party may elect to terminate the contract.\nBreach of Contract\nIf a party to a contract fails to meet its contractual obligations, perhaps by being unable to perform an act, or not delivering prescribed goods, or making a payment by a certain deadline, that party is in \"breach\" or \"default\" of the contract.\nWhen one party defaults under a contract for the first time, that does not necessarily entitle the non-defaulting party to immediately terminate or end the contract.

In order to qualify for leave, employees must have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, and they must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the requested leave.\n\n\n\n\nForce Majeure\n\n\nA clause that protects either or both parties from liability for breach of contract if an unforeseeable, unavoidable event makes it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual duties. In the event the cost of a Change Order is not known at the time a Change Order is executed,  shall estimate the cost thereof and  shall pay the actual cost whether or not this cost is in excess of the estimated cost. In the process of making your agreement, you also will have the ability to designate which state's jurisdiction it falls under. It applies to private businesses with at least 15 employees, as well as state and local governments.\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality\n\n\nA contractual agreement that one or both parties will not disclose private, confidential, or proprietary information that they encounter during the course of the contract. It becomes effective as of the date specified in the Contract.\n\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign with RocketSignÂ®\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a copy\nAnyone named in the document should receive a copy of the signed document.

MATERIALS AND/OR LABOR PROVIDED. NOTICE. NOTICE OF ALTERNATIVE BILLING CYCLE.

If someone brings a legal claim against the client under these circumstances, the contractor would be obligated to cover the clientâs costs.\n\n\n\n\nMaterial Default\n\n\nA significant failure to abide by or honor the terms of a contract, which may allow the non-breaching party to suspend or terminate the contract and/or recover damages from the breaching party. If the contract for the public building or improvement is for another purpose,  cannot provide indemnity as it is prohibited by 's public policy. If the contract is for services to be provided on an ongoing basis, installment payments may be preferred.\nProgress Payments\nIf the parties contract for progress payments, the details of these payments can be set forth under the heading Schedule of Progress Payments. If the cure period is not specified in the contract, then the time period given must be long enough to reasonably allow the defaulting party a chance to correct the problem.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution\nBoth mediation and arbitration are forms of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and offer an alternative to going to court, which can be expensive. If the party in default fails to remedy the situation in the specified number of days, the non-breaching party may elect to terminate the contract.\nBreach of Contract\nIf a party to a contract fails to meet its contractual obligations, perhaps by being unable to perform an act, or not delivering prescribed goods, or making a payment by a certain deadline, that party is in \"breach\" or \"default\" of the contract.\nWhen one party defaults under a contract for the first time, that does not necessarily entitle the non-defaulting party to immediately terminate or end the contract.

In order to qualify for leave, employees must have worked for a covered employer for at least 12 months, and they must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12 months immediately before the requested leave.\n\n\n\n\nForce Majeure\n\n\nA clause that protects either or both parties from liability for breach of contract if an unforeseeable, unavoidable event makes it impossible for them to fulfill their contractual duties. In the event the cost of a Change Order is not known at the time a Change Order is executed,  shall estimate the cost thereof and  shall pay the actual cost whether or not this cost is in excess of the estimated cost. In the process of making your agreement, you also will have the ability to designate which state's jurisdiction it falls under. It applies to private businesses with at least 15 employees, as well as state and local governments.\n\n\n\n\nConfidentiality\n\n\nA contractual agreement that one or both parties will not disclose private, confidential, or proprietary information that they encounter during the course of the contract. It becomes effective as of the date specified in the Contract.\n\nSecurely sign online and invite others to sign with RocketSignÂ®\n\n\n\n\n\nEveryone gets a copy\nAnyone named in the document should receive a copy of the signed document.

MATERIALS AND/OR LABOR PROVIDED. NOTICE. NOTICE OF ALTERNATIVE BILLING CYCLE.
